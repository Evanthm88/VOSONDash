# VOSON Dashboard

## Overview

`VOSON Dashboard` is an interactive [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application for the visualisation and analysis of social network data. The app has a dashboard layout with sections for visualising and manipulating network graphs, performing text analysis, displaying network metrics and the collection of network data using the [vosonSML](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML) R package.

## Installation

Installation simply requires [downloading](https://github.com/vosonlab/VOSONDash/archive/master.zip) the `VOSON Dashboard` files and unzipping them to a folder. The app is opened in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) by either creating a new project using the `VOSON Dashboard` directory or navigating to the folder using the RStudio File browser tab.

The latest `VOSON Dashboard` can be downloaded from the [VOSON lab](https://github.com/vosonlab) on github using the following link:
